\section{Motivation, Problem Statement, Related Work}

To foster new advances in applications for robots in areas that are too dangerous for humans, specifically for underground environments, the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the US Defense Department established the yearly ``SubT'' Challenge in 2017.
In this challenge, teams are tasked to ``Drive novel approaches and technologies to allow warfighters and first-responders to rapidly map, navigate, and search dynamic underground environments''~\cite{allen} proving the demand for further research in this domain.
One subtask of this challenge is building an accurate 3D model of the environment, i.e., mapping the surroundings. 
This paper shows a proof of concept of a such a novel approach and validates it with experiments.

One such approach using a 2D laser scanner to scan 3D indoor environments has been proposed in~\cite{classical_mechanics_scanner}.
The authors mount a 2D laser scanner on a cylindrical structure.
An operator then initiates a rolling motion by manually pushing the contraption.
This enables the scanner to sense the 3D environment successfully.
However, manually pushing the scanner is not practical, especially for long scans.
%
Previous work includes our RADLER (RADial LasER scanning device), which consists of a 2D laser scanner attached to the axle of a unicycle~\cite{ISER2018}.
An operator pushes the unicycle along a requested path.
The inherent rotation of the wheel creates a radial 3D laser scanning pattern.
However, this approach still requires an operator, therefore does not fulfill the autonomy requirements. 
%
A more autonomous approach was taken by Fang et al.~\cite{3D_per_2D_based}.
The authors mounted a rotating 2D laser-scanner on top of a turtle-bot thus removing the need of an operator.
In contrast to RADLER however, the turtle-bot does not provide an inherent rotation.
Therefore an additional actuator is required to create the radial 3D scanning-pattern. 

This paper builds upon the results of RADLER and has a specific application of mapping lunar craters autonomously in mind.
We propose a novel approach to low-cost 3D laser scanning using a 2D laser scanner inside a spherical robot based on impulse by conversation of angular momentum (IBCOAM): the L.U.N.A. - sphere (Laser-mapping Unidirectional Navigation Actuator).
The 2D laser scanner is fixed to the spherical structure, hence a similar situation as with the RADLER is given: the inherent rotation of the sphere creates a radial 3D scanning pattern.
Using the format of a spherical robot permits the system to be designed more compact. 
Additionally, the spherical shell doubles as a protective layer for the actuators, sensors and electronics. 
This is especially valuable for applications in rough terrain or scenarios in which non-minimal impact is expected, such as space applications.
During a launch, withstanding large G-forces is a necessary requirement, which can be better implemented using the spherical format. 
Furthermore, an operator is no longer required given a drive implemented in the robot.

The design of drive systems for self-driving spheres goes back as far as 1893 with a patent for a sphere driven by an inner moving counterweight, which got its torque from a spring~\cite{tate1893sphere}.
In the more recent past various approaches and their implementation have been presented which will be detailed in the final paper~\cite{soa1,soa2,soa3,soa4,soa5,soa6,soa7}.
In order to use the rotation axis of the sphere as an additional degree of freedom for the sensor, the sensor needs to be positioned close to the center of the sphere with as little occlusion as possible and the sensor cannot be used as part of a static counterweight inside the sphere.
This makes most of the existing approaches infeasible.
Inspired by the seminal Cubli \cite{cubliIROS12}, we started designing a spherical robot based on a impulse by conservation of momentum (IBCOAM) drive.

\section{Experiments completed}

All Experiments have been completed.

Multiple basic roll tests: as the driving mechanism is not the common approach, where the rotation of a non-homogenus mass-distribution leads to the rotation, several basic tests for the driving mechanism were conducted. 


Outdoor and indoor scanning tests: the environment scanning was tested indoor and outdoor. 

Stress test for the microcontroller: evaluating the amount of required tasks capable by the microcontroller itself  and therefore scaling the need of a server structure.

Single IMU vs triple IMU test: the difference between the use of a single IMU and the triple IMU approach presented in 
\ref{sec:TechnicalApproach} was evaluated.

\section{Main Experimental Insights}

The experiments lead to multiple hardware and software improvements.
The impulse by conservation of angular momentum drive accelerates the L.U.N.A. sphere reliably.
Figure \ref{sec:technicalApproach:fig:angvel} shows the angular acceleration of the whole sphere measured by the IMU system in one test run. 
Furthermore, it shows that the acceleration along the rotational axis of the flywheels rises while the accelerations along the other axes remain lower, albeit are noisy. 
However, it also shows the decrease in noise due to the combination of the IMU measurements.
The vibrations and tilt of the robot contribute to the velocities along the other axes.
The vibrations are results of inexact drilling of the flywheels such that there is an unbalance.
At the main test site the ground is a hard, clean and low friction concrete floor.
In such a scenario the vibrations add up and lead to slippage.
However, a rubber surface (a running track) absorb the vibrations, such that the acceleration process happens reliably.\newline
Furthermore the tests regarding the laser scanning showed the need of further improvement like re-positioning the laser scanner and the need for cutting windows into the sphere.
