\abstract{
This paper proposes an autonomous approach to 3D mapping using the concept of impulse by  conservation of angular momentum (IBCOAM) as a unidirectional drive to roll a 2D laser scanner in an IMU equipped, pose-tracked spherical robot system.
An experimental prototype of the robot is introduced, giving details about the hardware.
The laser scanning results as well as the IBCOAM drive data that have been gathered using the prototype are analyzed, revealing  technical challenges.
