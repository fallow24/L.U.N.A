%\abstract*{Each chapter should be preceded by an abstract (10--15 lines long) 
%that summarizes the content. The abstract will appear \textit{online} at 
%\url{www.SpringerLink.com} and be available with unrestricted access. This 
%allows unregistered users to read the abstract as a teaser for the complete 
%chapter. As a general rule the abstracts will not appear in the printed 
%version 
%of your book unless it is the style of your particular book or that of the 
%series to which your book belongs.
%Please use the 'starred' version of the new Springer \texttt{abstract} command 
%for typesetting the text of the online abstracts (cf. source file of this 
%chapter template \texttt{abstract}) and include them with the source files of 
%your manuscript. Use the plain \texttt{abstract} command if the abstract is 
%also to appear in the printed version of the book.}
