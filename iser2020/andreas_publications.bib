                  modeling. However, the reliable detection of such
                  artifacts is diminished when PCD is sparse and
                  corrupted by detection and spatial errors, for
                  example, when the sensing environment is
                  contaminated by high dust levels, such as in
                  mines. In the radar literature, constant false alarm
                  rate (CFAR) processors provide solutions for
                  extracting features within noisy data; however,
                  their direct application to sparse, 3-D PCD is
                  limited due to the difficulty in defining a suitable
                  noise window. Therefore, in this article, CFAR
                  detectors are derived, which are capable of
                  processing a 2-D projected version of the 3-D PCD or
                  which can directly process the 3-D PCD
                  itself. Comparisons of their robustness, with
                  respect to data sparsity, are made with various
                  state-of-the-art feature detection methods, such as
                  the Canny edge detector and random sampling

                  concept for plugging in sensor and actuator
                  platforms such as 3D LIDAR and visual sensor systems
                  and robot manipulator and gripper
                  systems. Integration, programming and operation of
                  heterogeneous robot systems (such as mobile
                  manipulators or robots in a machine network) are
                  very complex tasks for plant
                  operators. Heterogeneous system components have to
                  be orchestrated (via proprietary interfaces) by
                  higher-level control systems. Robot programs are
                  created offline, in proprietary tools, and used
                  through macros. System components are generally not
                  compatible and interchangeable across
                  manufacturers. These have to be programmed
                  separately in manufacturer-specific
                  tools. Cross-component debugging is difficult. The
                  operation of complex systems is difficult, requires
                  intensive training, and is currently limited to
                  simple graphical user interfaces (GUI). As part of
                  process optimization, it is usually necessary to
                  optimize process points during the start-up
                  phase. This requires highly skilled personnel
                  capable of robot programming at the plant operators
                  site. The combination of heterogeneous robot modules
                  results in many new hazardous situations. It is
                  therefore necessary to include an appropriate safety
                  concept. The goal is to design a robot payload
                  concept with a plug-and-play approach to be used as
                  a modular and flexible unit. This shall reduce the
                  effort for system integration and sensor calibrating
                  significantly and provide a customized perception of
                  the environment during certain work processes. The

                  several sensors and hardware components was
                  implemented as a prototype on a rescue robot. The

                  demands for accurate mapping. However, recent
                  backpack mobile mapping systems are mostly tested in
                  structured, indoor environments. This paper
                  evaluates the use of a backpack mobile mapping
                  system in a cave-like environment. The experiments

                  surveying with high resolution is still a complex
                  and difficult task.  In this paper, we present the

                  results on applying the system for mobile scanning

                  lasers to project a cross on the scene.  This
                  enables mobile scanning in multiple directions and
                  provides an overlapping scan pattern, which is

                  reconstruction methods used for creating point
                  clouds using the system.  In experiments conducted

                  for extracting inland mineral deposits in flooded
                  open-cut mines. From a floating launch and recovery
                  vessel a remotely-operated underwater mining vehicle
                  with a roadheader cutting machine is deployed. The
                  cut material is transported to the surface via a
                  flexible riser hose. Since there is no direct
                  intervisibility between the operator and the mining
                  machine, the data of the sensor systems can only be
                  perceived via a computer interface. Therefore, part
                  of the efforts in the project focus on enhancing the
                  situational awareness of the operator by providing a
                  3D model of the mine combined with representations
                  of the mining equipment and sensor data. We present
                  a method how a positioning and navigation system,

                  desirable to remove moving objects from a given data
                  set. Common examples for these moving objects are
                  pedestrians, bicycles and motor vehicles in outdoor
                  scans or manufactured goods and employees in indoor
                  scans of factories. We present a new change
                  detection method which is able to partition the
                  points of multiple registered 3D scans into two
                  sets: points belonging to stationary (static)
                  objects and points belonging to moving (dynamic)
                  objects. Our approach does not require any object
                  detection or tracking the movement of objects over
                  time. Instead, we traverse a voxel grid to find
                  differences in volumetric occupancy for “explicit”
                  change detection. Our main contribution is the
                  introduction of the concept of “point shadows” and
                  how to efficiently compute them. Without them, using
                  voxel grids for explicit change detection is known
                  to suffer from a high number of false positives when
                  applied to terrestrial scan data. Our solution
                  achieves similar quantitative results in terms of
                  F1-score as competing methods while at the same time
                  being faster."

                  that we want to simultaneously capture data above
                  and below water to create a consistent model without
                  any gaps. The employed structured light scanner
                  consist of a machine vision camera and a green line
                  laser. In order to reconstruct precise surface
                  models of the object it is necessary to model and
                  correct for the refraction of the laser line and
                  camera rays at the water-air boundary.  We derive a

                  manipulator to achieve reproducable scanner
                  trajectories with different incident angles. We show
                  that the proposed method is effective for refractive

                  an estimation of people standing in front of a

                  stream of depth images is used to obtain the body

                  algorithm first extracts features from a point cloud
                  and forwards them to an artificial neural network
                  (ANN) to obtain an estimation of body
                  weight. Besides the algorithm for the estimation,
                  this paper further presents an open-access dataset

                  impractical or downright impossible to free a scene
                  from all nonstatic clutter. Outdoor environments
                  contain pedestrians, bicycles, and motor vehicles
                  which cannot easily be stopped from entering the
                  sensor range and indoor environments like factory
                  production lines cannot be evacuated due to
                  production losses during the time of the scan. In
                  this letter, we present a solution to this problem
                  that we call the "peopleremover." Given a registered

                  process laser sensor measurements and output a map
                  as a point cloud of the environment. Often the
                  actual precision of the map remains unclear, since
                  SLAMalgorithms apply local improvements to the
                  resulting map. Unfortunately, it is not trivial to
                  compare the performance of SLAMalgorithms
                  objectively, especially without an accurate ground
                  truth. This paper presents a novel benchmarking
                  technique that allows to compare a precise map
                  generated with an accurate ground truth trajectory
                  to a map with a manipulated trajectory which was
                  distorted by different forms of noise. The accurate
                  ground truth is acquired by mounting a laser scanner
                  on an industrial robotic arm. The robotic arm is
                  moved on a predefined path while the position and
                  orientation of the end-effector tool are
                  monitored. During this process the 2D profile
                  measurements of the laser scanner are recorded in
                  six degrees of freedom and afterwards used to
                  generate a precise point cloud of the test
                  environment. For benchmarking, an offline
                  continuous-time SLAM algorithm is subsequently
                  applied to remove the inserted distortions. Finally,
                  it is shown that the manipulated point cloud is
                  reversible to its previous state and is slightly
                  improved compared to the original version, since
                  small errors that came into account by imprecise
                  assumptions, sensor noise and calibration errors are
                  removed as well.},

                  spaces are of high importance for various
                  applications in construction, indoor navigation and
                  real estate management. Mobile scanning techniques
                  are offering an efficient way to produce point
                  clouds, but with a lower accuracy than the
                  traditional terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). In
                  this paper, we first tackle the problem of how the
                  quality of a point cloud should be rigorously
                  evaluated. Previous evaluations typically operate on
                  some point cloud subset, using a manually-given
                  length scale, which would perhaps describe the
                  ranging precision or the properties of the
                  environment. Instead, the metrics that we propose
                  perform the quality evaluation to the full point
                  cloud and over all of the length scales, revealing
                  the method precision along with some possible
                  problems related to the point clouds, such as
                  outliers, over-completeness and misregistration. The
                  proposed methods are used to evaluate the end
                  product point clouds of some of the latest
                  methods. In detail, point clouds are obtained from
                  five commercial indoor mapping systems, Matterport,
                  NavVis, Zebedee, Stencil and Leica Pegasus:
                  Backpack, and three research prototypes, Aalto VILMA,
			   FGI Slammer and the W{\"u}rzburg backpack. These are
                  compared against survey-grade TLS point clouds
                  captured from three distinct test sites that each
                  have different properties. Based on the presented
                  experimental findings, we discuss the properties of
                  the proposed metrics and the strengths and
                  weaknesses of the above mapping systems and then

  Abstract     = {A favoured sensor for mapping is a 3D laser scanner
                  since it allows a wide scanning range, precise
                  measurements, and is usable indoor and
                  outdoor. Hence, a mapping module delivers detailed
                  and high resolution maps which makes it possible to
                  navigate safely. Difficulties result from
                  transparent and specular reflective objects which
                  cause erroneous and dubious measurements. At such
                  objects, based on the incident angle, measurements
                  result from the object surface, an object behind the
                  transparent surface, or an object mirrored with
                  respect to the reflective surface. This paper
                  describes an enhanced Pre-Filter-Module to
                  distinguish between these cases. Two experiments
                  demonstrate the usability and show that for single
                  scans the identification of mentioned objects in 3D
                  is possible. The first experiment was made in an
                  empty room with a mirror. The second experiment was
                  made in a stairway which contains a glass
                  door. Further, results show that a discrimination
                  between a specular reflective and a transparent
                  object is possible. Especially for transparent
                  objects the detected size is restricted to the
                  incident angle. That is why future work concentrates
                  on implementing a post-filter module. Gained
                  experience shows that collecting the data of
                  multiple scans and postprocess them as soon as the
                  object was bypassed will improve the map.},

                  fulfil advanced navigation and manipulation tasks a
                  3D representation of the environment is
                  required. Applying stereo cameras or Time-of-flight
                  cameras (TOF cameras) are one way to archive this
                  requirement. Unfortunately, they suffer from
                  drawbacks which makes it difficult to map
                  properly. Therefore, costly 3D laser scanners are
                  applied. An inexpensive way to build a 3D
                  representation is to use a 2D laser scanner and
                  rotate the scan plane around an additional axis. A
                  3D point cloud acquired with such a custom device
                  consists of multiple 2D line scans. Therefore the
                  scanner pose of each line scan need to be determined
                  as well as parameters resulting from a calibration
                  to generate a 3D point cloud. Using external sensor
                  systems are a common method to determine these
                  calibration parameters. This is costly and difficult
                  when the robot needs to be calibrated outside the
                  lab. Thus, this work presents a calibration method
                  applied on a rotating 2D laser scanner. It uses a
                  hardware setup to identify the required parameters
                  for calibration. This hardware setup is light,
                  small, and easy to transport. Hence, an out of lab
                  calibration is possible. Additional a theoretical
                  model was created to test the algorithm and analyse
                  impact of the scanner accuracy. The hardware
                  components of the 3D scanner system are an HOKUYO
                  UTM-30LX-EW 2D laser scanner, a Dynamixel
                  servo-motor, and a control unit. The calibration
                  system consists of an hemisphere. In the inner of
                  the hemisphere a circular plate is mounted. The
                  algorithm needs to be provided with a dataset of a
                  single rotation from the laser scanner. To achieve a
                  proper calibration result the scanner needs to be
                  located in the middle of the hemisphere. By means of
                  geometric formulas the algorithms determine the
                  individual deviations of the placed laser
                  scanner. In order to minimize errors, the algorithm
                  solves the formulas in an iterative process. First,
                  the calibration algorithm was tested with an ideal
                  hemisphere model created in Matlab. Second, laser
                  scanner was mounted differently, the scanner
                  position and the rotation axis was modified. In
                  doing so, every deviation, was compared with the
                  algorithm results. Several measurement settings were
                  tested repeatedly with the 3D scanner system and the
                  calibration system. The results show that the length
                  accuracy of the laser scanner is most critical. It
                  influences the required size of the hemisphere and
                  the calibration accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We present an efficient method to partition a point
                  cloud gathered through kinematic laser scanning into
                  static and dynamic points. The presented algorithm
                  utilizes a voxel grid data structure and uses a ray
                  intersection test to mark voxels as dynamic. The
                  algorithm does not require any ego-motion
                  estimations, computationally expensive object
                  recognition or tracking of moving objects over
                  time. It is easy to implement and can be executed on
                  many cores in parallel. We show the viability of
                  this approach by applying our algorithm to a dataset
                  that we gathered by mounting a FARO Focus3D Laser
                  scanner onto a skid which was then sent along a
                  production line for consumer car chassis in a
                  factory of the Volkswagen corporation. Since factory
                  operators are interested in acquiring digital models
                  of their production lines without suspending factory
                  operations, the resulting point cloud will contain
                  many dynamic objects like humans or other car
                  bodies. We show how our algorithm is able to
                  successfully remove these dynamic objects from the
                  resulting point cloud with minimal errors. Our
                  implementation is published under a free license as

                  color information. Therefore coloring is often done
                  by projecting photos of an additional camera to the
                  3D scans. The capturing process is time consuming
                  and therefore prone to changes in the
                  environment. The appearance of the colored point
                  cloud is mainly effected by changes of lighting
                  conditions and corresponding camera settings. In
                  case of panorama images these exposure variations
                  are typically corrected by radiometrical aligning
                  the input images to each other. In this paper we
                  adopt existing methods for panorama optimization in
                  order to correct the coloring of point
                  clouds. Therefore corresponding pixels from
                  overlapping images are selected by using
                  geometrically closest points of the registered 3D
                  scans and their neighboring pixels in the

                  in mobile service robotics at indoor and outdoor
                  applications, since they deliver precise
                  measurements at a wide scanning range. The resulting
                  maps are detailed since they have a high
                  resolution. Based on these maps robots navigate
                  through rough terrain, fulfil advanced manipulation,
                  and inspection tasks. In case of specular reflective
                  and transparent objects, e.g., mirrors, windows,
                  shiny metals, the laser measurements get
                  corrupted. Based on the type of object and the
                  incident angle of the incoming laser beam there are
                  three results possible: a measurement point on the
                  object plane, a measurement behind the object plane,
                  and a measurement of a reflected object. It is
                  important to detect such situations to be able to
                  handle these corrupted points. This paper describes
                  why it is difficult to distinguish between specular
                  reflective and transparent surfaces. It presents a
                  3D- Reflection-Pre-Filter Approach to identify
                  specular reflective and transparent objects in point
                  clouds of a multi-echo laser scanner. Furthermore,
                  it filters point clouds from influences of such
                  objects and extract the object properties for
                  further investigations. Based on an
                  Iterative-Closest-Point-algorithm reflective objects
                  are identified. Object surfaces and points behind
                  surfaces are masked according to their
                  location. Finally, the processed point cloud is
                  forwarded to a mapping module. Furthermore, the
                  object surface corners and the type of the surface
                  is broadcasted. Four experiments demonstrate the
                  usability of the 3D-Reflection-Pre-Filter. The first
                  experiment was made in a empty room containing a
                  mirror, the second experiment was made in a stairway
                  containing a glass door, the third experiment was
                  made in a empty room containing two mirrors, the
                  fourth experiment was made in an office room
                  containing a mirror. This paper demonstrate that for
                  single scans the detection of specular reflective
                  and transparent objects in 3D is possible. It is
                  more reliable in 3D as in 2D. Nevertheless, collect
                  the data of multiple scans and post-filter them as
                  soon as the object was bypassed should pursued. This
                  is why future work concentrates on implementing a
                  post-filter module. Besides, it is the aim to
                  improve the discrimination between specular
                  reflective and transparent objects.},

                  method applied in service, industrial, medical, and
                  rescue robotics. Although a lot of research has been
                  done, maps still suffer from interferences caused by
                  transparent and specular reflective objects. Glass,
                  mirrors, shiny or translucent surfaces cause
                  erroneous measurements depending on the incident
                  angle of the laser beam. In past experiments the
                  Mirror Detector Approach was implemented to
                  determine such measurements with a multi-echo laser
                  scanner. Recognition values are based on their

                  and material; and one experiment to show an applied
                  discrimination with the extended version of the
                  Mirror Detector, the Reflection Classifier
                  Approach. To verify the results, a comparison with
                  existing models was performed. This study showed
                  that shiny metals, like aluminium, etc., provide
                  significant characteristics, while mirrors are to be
                  characterized by a mixed model of glass and shiny
                  metal. Transparent objects turned out to be
                  challenging because their appearance in the sensor
                  data strongly depends on the
                  background. Nevertheless, these experiments show
                  that discrimination of transparent and reflective
                  materials based on the reflected intensity is
                  possible and feasible.},

  abstract     = {Detecting moving objects is of great importance for
                  autonomous unmanned vehicle systems, and a
                  challenging task especially in complex dynamic
                  environments. This paper proposes a novel approach
                  for the detection of moving objects and the
                  estimation of their motion states using consecutive
                  stereo image pairs on mobile platforms. First, we
                  use a variant of the semi-global matching algorithm
                  to compute initial disparity maps. Second, assisted
                  by the initial disparities, boundaries in the image
                  segmentation produced by simple linear iterative
                  clustering are classified into coplanar, hinge, and
                  occlusion. Moving points are obtained during
                  ego-motion estimation by a modified random sample
                  consensus) algorithm without resorting to
                  time-consuming dense optical flow. Finally, the
                  moving objects are extracted by merging superpixels
                  according to the boundary types and their
                  movements. The proposed method is accelerated on the
                  GPU at 20 frames per second. The data which we use
                  for testing and benchmarking is released, thus
                  completing similar data sets. It includes 812 image
                  pairs and 924 moving objects with ground truth for
                  better algorithms evaluation. Experimental results
                  demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
                  competitive results in terms of moving-object
                  detection and their motion state estimation in
                  challenging urban scenarios.},

                  localization solution for a single two-dimensional
                  (2D) laser scanner from one into (quasi) three
                  dimensions (3D). By intrinsic localization, we mean
                  that no external sensors are used to localize the

                  or global navigation satellite systems

                  a novel concept of local support-based filtering of
                  outliers, which enables the use of six

                  recover trajectories with steep curvature, but in

                  emergency patients in a trauma room, based on images
                  from a RGBD sensor and a thermal camera. The
                  improvements are archived by several extensions: The
                  sensor fusion of RGBD and thermal camera eases
                  filtering and segmentation of the patient's body
                  from the background. Robustness and accuracy is
                  gained by an artificial neural network (ANN), which
                  considers features from the sensors as input to
                  calculate the patient's body weight, e.g. the
                  patient's volume, surface and shape parameters. The
                  ANN is trained offline with 30 percent of the
                  patients data. Preliminary experiments with 69 real
                  patients show an accuracy close to 90 percent for a
                  threshold of ten percent relative error in real body
                  estimation. Results are compared to the patient's
                  self estimation, a physician's guess and an
                  anthropometric method: If the patient is
                  knowledgeable it is the best possibility for body
                  weight adapted drug dosages with 97 percent
                  accuracy. The treating physicians and the
                  anthropometric estimation achieve an accuracy of
                  approximately 70 percent. The here presented
                  approach gets an accuracy of nearly 90 percent and

                  with conventional methods and tools such as hand
                  drawings, measuring tape and archaeological notes is
                  time consuming. This process is prone to human
                  errors and the quality of the documentation depends
                  on the qualification of the archaeologist on
                  site. Use of modern technology and methods in 3D
                  surveying and 3D robotics facilitate and improve
                  this process. Computer-aided systems and databases
                  improve the documentation quality and increase the
                  speed of data acquisition. 3D laser scanning is the
                  state of the art in modelling archaeological
                  excavation sites, historical sites and even entire
                  cities or landscapes. Modern laser scanners are
                  capable of data acquisition of up to 1 million
                  points per second. This provides a very detailed 3D
                  point cloud of the environment. 3D point clouds and
                  3D models of an excavation site provide a better
                  representation of the environment for the
                  archaeologist and for documentation. The point cloud
                  can be used both for further studies on the
                  excavation and for the presentation of results. This
                  paper introduces a Computer aided system for
                  labelling archaeological excavations in 3D
                  (CASTLE3D). Consisting of a set of tools for
                  recording and georeferencing the 3D data from an
                  excavation site, CASTLE3D is a novel documentation
                  approach in industrial archaeology. It provides a 2D
                  and 3D visualisation of the data and an easy-to-use
                  interface that enables the archaeologist to select
                  regions of interest and to interact with the data in
                  both representations. The 2D visualisation and a 3D
                  orthogonal view of the data provide cuts of the
                  environment that resemble the traditional hand
                  drawings. The 3D perspective view gives a realistic
                  view of the environment. CASTLE3D is designed as an
                  easy-to-use on-site semantic mapping tool for
                  archaeologists. Each project contains a predefined
                  set of semantic information that can be used to
                  label findings in the data. Multiple regions of
                  interest can be joined under one label. Further
                  information such as color, orientation and
                  archaeological notes are added to the label to
                  improve the documentation. The available 3D
                  information allows for easy measurements in the
                  data. The full 3D information of a region of
                  interest can be segmented from the entire data. By
                  joining this data from different georeferenced views
                  the full 3D shape of findings is stored. All the
                  generated documentation in CASTLE3D is exported to
                  an XML format and serves as input for other systems
                  and databases. Apart from presenting the
                  functionalities of CASTLE3D we evaluate its
                  documentation process in a sample project. For this
                  purpose we export the data to the Adiuvabit database
                  (http://adiuvabit.de) where more information is
                  added for further analysis. The documentation
                  process is compared to traditional documentation
                  methods and it is shown how the automated system
                  helps in accelerating the documentation process and
                  decreases errors to a minimum.},

                  robotics. Although a lot of work has been done in
                  laser-based SLAM, maps still suffer from
                  interferences caused by objects like glass, mirrors
                  and shiny or translucent surfaces. Depending on the
                  surface's reflectivity, a laser beam is deflected
                  such that returned measurements provide wrong
                  distance data. At certain positions phantom-like
                  objects appear. This paper describes a specular
                  reflectance detection approach applicable to the
                  emerging technology of multi-echo laser scanners in
                  order to identify and filter reflective objects. Two
                  filter stages are implemented. The first filter
                  reduces errors in current scans on the fly. A second

                  mapping of urban areas and for performing some
                  specific tasks. The second mobility aspect is
                  related with a novel Software as a Ser- vice system
                  that allows access to robotic functionalities and
                  data over the Ethernet, thus we demonstrate the use
                  of the novel NVIDIA GRID technology allowing to
                  virtualize the graphic processing unit. We introduce
                  Complex Shape Histogram, a core component of our
                  artificial intelligence engine, used for classifying
                  3D point clouds with a Support Vector Machine. We
                  use Complex Shape Histograms also for loop closing
                  detection in the simultaneous localization and
                  mapping algorithm. Our intelligent mobile system is
                  built on top of the Qualitative Spatio-Temporal
                  Representa- tion and Reasoning framework. This
                  framework defines an ontology and a semantic model,

                  for 3D point clouds. We map the point cloud onto

                  that are carried by a human operator to acquire
                  measurements of the environment while walking. These
                  systems were first designed to overcome the
                  challenges of mapping indoor environments with doors
                  and stairs. While the human operator inherently has
                  the ability to open doors and to climb stairs, the
                  flexible movements introduce irregularities of the
                  trajectory to the system. To compete with other

  abstract     = {Context: An important task in civil engineering is
                  the detection of collisions of a 3D model with an
                  environment representation. Existing methods using
                  the structure gauge provide an insufficient measure
                  because the model either rotates or because the
                  trajectory makes tight turns through narrow
                  passages. This is the case in either automotive
                  assembly lines or in narrow train
                  tunnels. Objective: Given two point clouds, one of
                  the environment and one of a model and a trajectory
                  with six degrees of freedom along which the model
                  moves through the environment, find all colliding
                  points of the environment with the model within a
                  certain clearance radius. Method: This paper
                  presents two collision detection (CD) methods called
                  kd-CD and kd-CD-simple and two penetration depth
                  (PD) calculation methods called kd-PD and
                  kd-PD-fast. All four methods are based on searches
                  in a k-d tree representation of the environment. The
                  creation of the k-d tree, its search methods and
                  other features will be explained in the scope of
                  their use to detect collisions and calculate depths
                  of penetration. Results: The algorithms are
                  benchmarked by moving the point cloud of a train
                  wagon with 2.5 million points along the point cloud
                  of a 1144m long train track through a narrow tunnel
                  with overall 18.92 million points. Points where the
                  wagon collides with the tunnel wall are visually
                  highlighted with their penetration depth. With a
                  safety margin of 5cm kd-PD-simple finds all
                  colliding points on its trajectory which is sampled
                  into 19,392 positions in 77s on a standard desktop
                  machine of 1.6GHz. Conclusion: The presented methods
                  for collision detection and penetration depth
                  calculation are shown to solve problems for which
                  the structure gauge is an insufficient measure. The
                  underlying k-d tree is shown to be an effective data
                  structure for the required look-up operations.},

                  technique is proposed to increase the exploration
                  efficiency. In particular, the new technique has two
                  main objectives: firstly, it aims at reducing the
                  exploration time and the traveled distance by
                  reducing the overlap which takes place when a
                  certain area in the environment is explored by more
                  than one robot. To achieve this, a new procedure to
                  assign the next target location for each individual
                  robot is proposed. And secondly, it aims at reducing
                  computations complexity required by target selection
                  and path planning tasks. More importantly, the
                  proposed technique obviates the need for environment
                  segmentation complex procedures which is adopted in
                  some previous important research works. The new
                  technique is intensively tested with different

                  algorithms is presented for building the fundamental
                  semantics of a 3D model. Among other things, these
                  algorithms enable the system to differentiate
                  between objects in a room and objects that are part
                  of the room, e.g. floor, windows. Subsequently, the
                  thermal information is used to construct a
                  stochastic mathematical model– namely Markov Random
                  Field– of the temperature distribution of the
                  detected windows. As a result, the MAP(Maximum a
                  posteriori) framework is used to further label the
                  windows as either open, closed or damaged based upon
                  their temperature distribution. The experimental
                  results showed the robustness of the
                  techniques. Furthermore, a strategy to optimize the
                  free parameters is described, in cases where there
                  is a sample training dataset.},

                  arbitrary 2D/3D depth sensing units exploiting
                  assets of the signed distance function. The
                  underlying framework generalizes the KinectFusion
                  approach with an objectoriented model respecting
                  different sensor modalities. For instance,
                  measurements of 2D/3D laser range finders and RGB-D
                  cameras can be integrated into the same
                  representation. Exemplary, an environment is
                  reconstructed with a 3D laser range finder, while
                  adding fine details from objects of interest by
                  closer inspection with an RGB-D sensor. A typical
                  application of this approach is the exploration in
                  rescue environments, where large-scale mapping is
                  performed on the basis of long-range laser range
                  finders while hollows are inspected with lightweight

                  exploration strategies for a team of mobile robots
                  equipped with continuously rotating 3D scanners. The
                  main aim of the new strategies is to reduce the
                  exploration time of unknown environment. Unlike most
                  of other published works, to save time, the laser
                  scanners rotate and scan the environment while
                  robots are in motion. Furthermore, the new
                  strategies are able to explore large outdoor
                  environments as a considerable reduction of the
                  required computations, especially those required for
                  path planning, have been achieved. Moreover, another
                  new exploration strategy has been developed so that
                  robots continuously replan the order to visit the
                  remaining unexplored areas according to the new data
                  (i.e. updated map) collected by the robot in
                  question or by the other team members. This new
                  extension led to further enhancements over the above
                  mentioned ones, but with slightly higher
                  computational costs. Finally, to assess our new
                  exploration strategies with different levels of
                  environment complexity, new set of experiments were
                  conducted in environments where obstacles are
                  distributed according to the Hilbert curve. The
                  results of these experiments show the effectiveness
                  of the proposed technique to effectively distribute
                  the robots over the environment. More importantly,
                  we show how the optimal number of robots is related
                  to the environment complexity.},

                  electricity and a heating or cooling system these
                  days. Factories and data centers are equally
                  dependent on a continuous functioning of these
                  systems. As beneficial as this development is for
                  our daily life, the consequences of a failure are
                  critical. Malfunctioning power supplies or
                  temperature regulation systems can cause the
                  close-down of an entire factory or data center. Heat
                  and air conditioning losses in buildings lead to a
                  large waste of the limited energy resources and
                  pollute the environment unnecessarily. To detect
                  these flaws as quickly as possible and to prevent
                  the negative consequences constant monitoring of
                  power lines and heat sources is necessary. To this
                  end, we propose a fully automatic system that
                  creates 3D thermal models of indoor
                  environments. The proposed system consists of a
                  mobile platform that is equipped with a 3D laser
                  scanner, an RGB camera and a thermal camera. A novel
                  3D exploration algorithm ensures efficient data
                  collection that covers the entire scene. The data
                  from all sensors collected at different positions is
                  joined into one common reference frame using
                  calibration and scan matching. In the
                  post-processing step a model is built and points of
                  interest are automatically detected. A viewer is
                  presented that aids experts in analyzing the heat
                  flow and localizing and identifying heat
                  leaks. Results are shown that demonstrate the
                  functionality of the system.},

  abstract     = {Measuring the structure gauge of tunnels and other
                  narrow passages has so far been the only way to
                  evaluate whether large vehicles can pass through
                  them. But especially for very long vehicles like
                  train wagons and their cargo, the structure gauge is
                  an insufficient measure because the center part of
                  the vehicle between two bogies will inevitably leave
                  the swept volume of its cross section when moving
                  along any other trajectory than a straight line
                  perpendicular to its cross section. In addition, the
                  vehicle as well as the cargo must keep a minimum
                  safety margin from the environment at all points of
                  its trajectory. This paper explores an automated
                  method to check for possible collisions of a model
                  represented by a 3D point cloud moving through the
                  3D point cloud of an environment. We were given
                  environment data of a train track through a narrow
                  tunnel where simply relying on the structure gauge
                  would indicate that a given wagon would pass through
                  without any collision even though in reality, the
                  train wagon would collide with the inner tunnel wall
                  inside a sharp turn of the tracks. The k-d tree
                  based collision detection method presented in this
                  paper is able to correctly highlight these
                  collisions and indicate the penetration depth of
                  each colliding point of the environment into the
                  model of the train wagon. It can be generalized for
                  any setup where two static point clouds have to be
                  tested for intersection along a trajectory.},

                  technical human-robot telepresence setup that allows
                  a human observer to explore a VE, which is a 3D
                  reconstruction of the real world based on point
                  clouds. Such point cloud virtual environments
                  (PCVEs) represent the external environment, and are
                  usually acquired by 3D scanners. We present an
                  application scenario, in which a mobile robot
                  captures 3D scans of a terrestrial environment,
                  which are automatically registered to a coherent
                  PCVE. This virtual 3D reconstruction is displayed in
                  an immersive virtual environment (IVE) in which a
                  user can explore the PCVE. We explain and describe
                  the technical setup, which opens up new vistas of
                  presenting a VE as points rather than a polygonal
                  representation.},

                  various types of road scenarios in real urban

                  when only perception sensors are used, without

                  real-time optimal-drivable-region and lane detection
                  system for autonomous driving based on the fusion of
                  light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and vision
                  data. Our system uses a multisensory scheme to cover
                  the most drivable areas in front of a vehicle. We
                  propose a feature-level fusion method for the LIDAR
                  and vision data and an optimal selection strategy
                  for detecting the best drivable region. Then, a
                  conditional lane detection algorithm is selectively
                  executed depending on the automatic classification
                  of the optimal drivable region. Our system

                  any intelligent autonomous system such as autonomous
                  cars or personal robots. The representation of 3D

                  theory via the curvature scale space and extend it
                  to represent 3D objects in our new SCSS (Sliced
                  Curvature Scale Space) framework. We further develop
                  techniques of further processing the SCSS

                  dimensionality reduction for use in learning

                  targets consistently, the DPCR is developed to
                  calculate accurately the pose of the ego-vehicle for
                  the transformation of raw measurements taken in the
                  moving coordinate systems into a static absolute
                  coordinate system; while in turn, MHT helps to
                  improve the performance of DPCR by discriminating
                  and removing the dynamic points from the
                  scene. Furthermore, the proposed MHT method is also
                  able to solve the occlusion problem existing in the
                  point cloud. Experiments on sets of urban
                  environments prove that the presented method is
                  effective and robust, even in highly dynamic
                  environments.},

                  has reached the point, where so-called Passivhaus
                  buildings make extensive use of the intrinsic heat
                  from internal sources such as waste heat from
                  lighting, white goods, and other electrical devices,
                  but without using dedicated heaters. In our approach
                  for creating high-precise heat distribution maps a
                  robot is equipped with a 3D laser scanner, a thermal
                  camera, and a color camera. Data from all the
                  sensors are combined to model the environment
                  precisely. This paper describes the setup of the
                  sensors and the processing of the acquired data,
                  including the automatic co-calibration needed to
                  fulfill this task.},

                  given unknown environment as fast as possible, while
                  coordinating their actions and sharing their local

                  energy as we are today. But the natural ressources
                  are limited and a waste of energy has drastic
                  influences on the environment. In their Action Plan
                  for Energy Efficiency [6] the European Commission
                  estimates that the largest and cost-effictive energy
                  savings potential lies in residential ($\sim$27\%)
                  and commercial ($\sim$30\%) buildings. To eliminate
                  heat and air conditioning losses in buildings and
                  factories heat and air leaks need to be localized
                  and identified. Imagine the availability of a
                  complete 3D model of every building that architects
                  can use to analyze the heat insulation of buildings
                  and to identify necessary modifications. In these 3D
                  models temperature peaks are not only detectable but
                  also their extent is visible. A robot equiped with a
                  3D laser scanner, a thermal camera, and a color
                  camera constitutes the basis for our approach. The

                  the point cloud and clear the cells which belong to
                  other vehicles. Then, the proposed beam model is
                  applied with a specified distance in front of

                  neben Strukturmerkmalen wie 3D-Fl{\"a}chen oft
                  Bildmerkmale zum Einsatz. Dazu wird ein fl{\"a}chiges

                  2-dimensional data sets. For 3D it has attained
                  little attention so far. Even for the 2D case high
                  computational costs have lead to the development of
                  numerous variations for the Hough Transform. In this

                  Transform with respect to their applicability to

                  from computational costs, the main problem is the

                  strategy must have good performance in any
                  environment that can be systematically constructed
                  inside a simulator. This paper presents an
                  evaluation of exploration strategies we developed
                  for a specific sensor. A continously rotating 3D
                  laser scanner that scans only into one direction at
                  a time moves through the environment sampling the
                  surrounding. Our evaluation framework features an
                  efficient scanning and robot simulator for kinematic
                  feasible trajectories. We will show that shorter
                  trajectories do not necessarily imply quicker
                  exploration. A simple simulator framework is
                  sufficient for evaluating these properties of path
                  planning algorithms. },

  abstract     = {Geodesy and surveying are the sciences for
                  monitoring the earth. In recent years traditional
                  surveying equipment has been pushed aside by the
                  emerging technology of laser scanners, that automate
                  the precise measurement of points in the
                  environment. A further step of automation is
                  achieved by operating the surveying equipment
                  automatically and the usage of robotic
                  mapping. Thus, robotic mapping will become a key
                  component in monitoring and surveillance tasks. This
                  paper evaluates a 3D laser scanner from surveying
                  for its usage in robotic monitoring tasks. We
                  examine how seasonal changes and weather conditions
                  impact the data of the 3D scanner and how to deal
                  with these changes. For this analysis 3D scans of
                  various predetermined locations on the campus of the
                  Jacobs University Bremen were taken on a weekly
                  basis over a period of 13 weeks using the RIEGL
                  VZ-400 3D laser range finder. The scans have been
                  registered by means of conventional surveying
                  markers, SIFT features and using our point cloud
                  based 6D SLAM framework. An analysis of the changes
                  in the environment over the course of the scanning
                  period and an evaluation of the matching results

                  robot pose with respect to the map. To solve the

                  control cycle, the 6D pose change is estimated a
                  priori from odometry or IMU, the expected ToF camera

                  problem in the simultaneous localization and mapping

                  handle the greatly increased amount of data and how
                  to efficiently obtain invariance to 3D rotations. We
                  present a compact representation of 3D point clouds
                  that is still discriminative enough to detect loop
                  closures without false positives (i.e., detecting
                  loop closure where there is none). A low
                  false-positive rate is very important because wrong
                  data association could have disastrous consequences
                  in a SLAM algorithm. Our approach uses only the
                  appearance of 3D point clouds to detect loops and
                  requires no pose information. We exploit the normal
                  distributions transform surface representation to
                  create feature histograms based on surface
                  orientation and smoothness. The surface shape
                  histograms compress the input data by two to three
                  orders of magnitude. Because of the high compression
                  rate, the histograms can be matched efficiently to
                  compare the appearance of two scans. Rotation
                  invariance is achieved by aligning scans with
                  respect to dominant surface orientations. We also
                  propose to use expectation maximization to fit a
                  gamma mixture model to the output similarity
                  measures in order to automatically determine the
                  threshold that separates scans at loop closures from
                  nonoverlapping ones. We discuss the problem of
                  determining ground truth in the context of loop
                  detection and the difficulties in comparing the
                  results of the few available methods based on range
                  information. Furthermore, we present quantitative
                  performance evaluations using three real-world data
                  sets, one of which is highly self-similar, showing
                  that the proposed method achieves high recall rates
                  (percentage of correctly identified loop closures)
                  at low false-positive rates in environments with
                  different characteristics.},

                  (ToF) cameras in mapping tasks for autonomous mobile
                  robots, in particular in simultaneous localization
                  and mapping (SLAM) tasks. Although ToF cameras are
                  in principle an attractive type of sensor for
                  three-dimensional (3D) mapping owing to their high
                  rate of frames of 3D data, two features make them
                  difficult as mapping sensors, namely, their
                  restricted field of view and influences on the
                  quality of range measurements by high dynamics in
                  object reflectivity; in addition, currently
                  available models suffer from poor data quality in a
                  number of aspects. The paper first summarizes
                  calibration and filtering approaches for improving
                  the accuracy, precision, and robustness of ToF
                  cameras independent of their intended usage. Then,
                  several ego motion estimation approaches are applied
                  or adapted, respectively, in order to provide a
                  performance benchmark for registering ToF camera
                  data. As a part of this, an extension to the
                  iterative closest point algorithm has been developed
                  that increases the robustness under restricted field
                  of view and under larger displacements. Using an
                  indoor environment, the paper provides results from
                  SLAM experiments using these approaches in
                  comparison. It turns out that the application of ToF
                  cameras is feasible to SLAM tasks, although this
                  type of sensor has a complex error characteristic.},

                  problem of building a map of an unknown environment
                  by a mobile robot while at the same time navigating
                  the environment, using the unfinished map. For SLAM,
                  two tasks have to be solved: First reliable feature
                  extraction and data association, second the optimal
                  estimation of poses and features. These two parts
                  are often referred to as SLAM frontend and
                  backend. Algorithms that solve SLAM by using laser
                  scans commonly rely on matching closest points in
                  the frontend part. Then the SLAM front- and backend
                  have to be iterated to ensure that the map
                  converges.  This paper presents a novel approach for
                  solving SLAM using 3D laser range scans. We aim at
                  avoiding the iteration between the SLAM front- and
                  backend and propose a novel explicit loop closing
                  heuristic (ELCH). It dissociates the last scan of a
                  sequence of acquired scans, reassociates it to the
                  map, built so far by scan registration, and
                  distributes the difference in the pose error over
                  the SLAM graph. We describe ELCH in the context of
                  SLAM with 3D scans considering 6 DoF. The
                  performance is evaluated using ground truth data of
                  an urban environment. },

                  of interest are detected by a biologically motivated

                  by a fast classifier based on the Adaboost learning

                  restricted to a small data subset. The approach has
                  two advantages over normal classification: First,
                  the system becomes considerably faster, which is an
                  important factor for real-time systems. Second,
                  since the attention system is able to make use of
                  top-down target-information, the combination of the
                  systems yields a significant reduction of false

  abstract     = {Intelligent autonomous acting of mobile robots in
                  unstructured environments requires 3D maps. Since
                  manual mapping is a tedious job, automatization of
                  this job is necessary. Automatic, consistent
                  volumetric modeling of environments requires a
                  solution to the simultaneous localization and map
                  building problem (SLAM problem). In 3D this task is
                  computationally expensive, since the environments
                  are sampled with many data points with state of the
                  art sensing technology. In addition, the solution
                  space grows exponentially with the additional
                  degrees of freedom needed to represent the robot
                  pose. Mapping environments in 3D must regard six
                  degrees of freedom to characterize the robot
                  pose. This paper summarizes our 6D SLAM algorithm
                  and presents novel algorithmic and technical means
                  to reduce computation time, i.e., the data structure
                  cached k-d tree and parallelization. The
                  availability of multi-core processors as well as
                  efficient programming schemes as OpenMP permit the
                  parallel execution of robotics tasks. },

                  environments calls for 3D maps. 3D geometry is
                  necessary for avoiding collision with complex
                  obstacles and to self localize in six degrees of
                  freedom (6 DoF) (x, y, z positions, roll, yaw, and
                  pitch angles). Meaning, in addition to geometry,
                  becomes inevitable if the robot is supposed to
                  interact with its environment in a goal-directed
                  way. A semantic stance enables the robot to reason
                  about objects; it helps disambiguate or round off
                  sensor data; and the robot knowledge becomes
                  reviewable and communicable.  The paper describes an
                  approach and a completed robot system for semantic
                  mapping. The prime sensor is a 3D laser
                  scanner. Individual scans are registered into a
                  coherent 3D geometry map by 6D SLAM. Coarse scene
                  features (e.g., walls, floors in a building) are
                  determined by semantic labeling. More delicate
                  objects are then detected by a trained classifier
                  and localized. In the end, the semantic maps can be
                  visualized for human inspection. We sketch the
                  overall architecture of the approach, explain the
                  respective steps and their underlying algorithms,
                  give examples based on a working robot
                  implementation, and discuss the findings. },

                  roboticists’ attention. On a phenomenological level,
                  it allows functions, which have “somehow” been
                  implemented, to be described using a new
                  terminology. However, that does not mean that the
                  affordance notion is of help for building robots and
                  their controllers. This paper explores viewing an
                  affordance as an abstraction from a
                  robot-environment relation that is of
                  inter-individual use, but requires an individual
                  implementation. Therefore, the notion of affordance
                  helps share environment representations and theories
                  among robots. Examples are given for navigability,
                  as afforded by environments of different types to

                  namely, the x, y and z coordinates and the roll, yaw

                  natural surfaces, e.g., driving outdoor with a
                  mobile robot, must regard these degrees of
                  freedom. This paper presents a robotic mapping
                  method based on locally consistent 3D laser range
                  scans. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan matching,
                  combined with a heuristic for closed loop detection
                  and a global relaxation method, results in a highly
                  precise mapping system. A new strategy for fast data
                  association, cached kd tree search, leads to
                  feasible computing times. With no ground-truth data
                  available for outdoor environments, point relations
                  in maps are compared to numerical relations in
                  uncalibrated aerial images in order to assess the

                  is Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): A
                  mobile robot has to localize itself in an unknown
                  environment, and at the same time generate a map of
                  the surrounding area. One fundamental part of SLAM
                  algorithms is loop closing: The robot detects
                  whether it has reached an area that has been visited
                  before, and uses this information to improve the
                  pose estimate in the next step. In this work, visual
                  camera features are used to assist closing the loop

                  suited for reliable silhouette

                  reliable contour extraction with floor
                  interpretation, feature extraction using a new, fast
                  eigen-CSS method, and a supervised learning

                  tested on range images acquired with a mobile robot,

                  the development of interaction between both
                  vehicles. Kurt3D is able to autonomously explore and
                  map the environment in 3D and search for
                  victims. The RTS Crawler is designed to access more
                  demanding territory (i.e., red arena), working
                  either remote controlled or semi-autonomous. The key
                  innovation of this system lies in the capability for
                  autonomous 6D SLAM (simultaneous localization and
                  mapping) and 3D map generation of natural scenes,
                  combined with the intelligent cooperation between
                  robots that enables one operator to efficiently map
                  and explore the whole arena.  The robots are

                  e.g., 3D laser range finders, infrared camera and
                  CO2-sensor. Robots as well as operator station are
                  rather compact and easy to set up. The challenge of
                  controlling two rescue robots with only one operator
                  is managed with a redesigned user interface and a

                  processing data from different sensor modes
                  simultaneously. Considering several sensor
                  modalities is an obvious approach to regard a
                  variety of ob ject properties. Nevertheless,
                  conventional att ention systems only regard the
                  processing of camera images. In contrast to these
                  systems, the input data to our system is provided by
                  a bimodal 3D laser scanner, mounted on top of an
                  autonomous mobile robot. In a single 3D scan pass,
                  the scanner yields range as well as reflectance
                  data. Both dat a modes are illumination independent,
                  yielding a robust approach that enables all day
                  operation. Data from both laser modes are fed into
                  our attention system built on principles of one of
                  the standard models of visual attention by Koch &
                  Ullman. The system computes conspicuities of both
                  modes in parallel and fuses them into one saliency
                  map. The focus of attention is directed to the most
                  salient points in this map sequentially. We present
                  results on recorded scans of indoor and outdoor
                  scenes showing the respective advantages of the

                  version of the mobile robot Kurt3D was developed in
                  our groups during the last year [1]. The key
                  innovation of this system lies in the capability for
                  autonomous or operator-assisted 6D SLAM
                  (simultaneous localization and mapping) and 3D map
                  generation of natural scenes. Hence, Kurt3D already
                  meets the basic requirement regarding urban search
                  and rescue. For the rescue robot league competition,
                  it is additionally configured with dedicated
                  state-of-the-art equipment e.g. infrared camera and
                  CO2sensor. The robot and the operator station are
                  rather compact and easy to set up. The operator uses
                  a joystick as a remote control for the robot and can
                  watch a live video of the scene where the robot
                  drives. Data are transmitted via wireless LAN. A 3D
                  laser scanner, which is mounted on an outdoor
                  variant of Kurt3D, is used as the main sensor for
                  map generation as well as for navigation and
                  localization. The whole system has been used with a
                  proven record of success for different tasks of map

                  rescue. For the rescue robot league competition, it
                  is additionally configured with dedicated
                  state-of-the-art equipment. The robot and the
                  operator station are rather compact and easy to set
                  up. The operator uses a joystick as a remote control
                  for the robot and can watch a live video of the
                  scene where the robot drives. Data are transmitted
                  via wireless LAN. A 3D laser scanner, which is
                  mounted on an outdoor variant of KURT3D, is used as
                  the main sensor for map generation as well as for
                  navigation and localization. The whole system has

                  system for gaging and digitalization of 3D indoor
                  environments. It consists of an autonomous mobile
                  robot, a reliable 3D laser range finder and three
                  elaborated software modules. The first module, a
                  fast variant of the Iterative Closest Points
                  algorithm, registers the 3D scans in a common
                  coordinate system and relocalizes the robot. The
                  second module, a next best view planner, computes
                  the next nominal pose based on the acquired 3D data
                  while avoiding complicated obstacles. The third
                  module, a closed-loop and globally stable motor
                  controller, navigates the mobile robot to a nominal
                  pose on the base of odometry and avoids collisions
                  with dynamical obstacles. The 3D laser range finder
                  acquires a 3D scan at this pose. The proposed method
                  allows one to digitalize large indoor environments
                  fast and reliably without any intervention and
                  solves the SLAM problem. The results of two 3D
                  digitalization experiments are presented using a
                  fast octree-based visualization method.},

                  laser range finder designed for autonomous mobile
                  systems. The 3D laser is built on the bas e of a 2D
                  range finder by the extension with a standard
                  servo. The servo is controlled by a computer running
                  RT-Linux. The scan resolution (5 cm) f or a complete
                  3D scan of an area of 150 (h) 90 (v) degree is up to
                  115000 points and can be grabbed in 12
                  seconds. Standard resolutions e.g. 150 (h) 90 (v)
                  degree with 22500 points are grabbed in 4
                  seconds. While scanning, different online algorithms
                  for line and surface detection are applied to the
                  data. Object segmentation and detection are done
                  offline after the scan. The implemented software

                  real-time is improved. 1. Introduction Prognoses at
                  the beginning of the nineties claimed for the new
                  millennium a number of about 50.000 independently
                  operating autonomous service robots in different
                  areas of production and service sectors [1]. The
                  reality is different. In industrial environments
                  guided vehicles, i.e. vehicles guided by a magnetic
                  or optical track are standard [2]. Autonomous mobile
                  service systems, i.e. systems not restricted by a
                  track, are used extremely rarely although many
                  research groups are working on this since sev eral
                  years particularly with mobile systems for
                  transportation tasks, e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6]. One of
                  several reasons for the gap between prognoses and r
                  eality is the lack of good, cheap and fast sensors
                  that allow the robots to sense the environment in
                  real-time and to act on the basis of the acquir ed
                  data. This paper presents a 3D laser range finder
                  designed for autonomous mobile systems (fig. 1). A
                  large number of today's autonomous robots us e 2D
                  laser range finders as a proximity sensor. They are
                  very fast (processing time 30 ms), precise ( 1 cm, )
                  and becoming cheaper (\$3000) since th ere are at
                  least two competing products [7, 8]. },
